# Agent Guidelines

This document provides guidance for AI agents (Cursor, Claude, Copilot, etc.) working on this repository.

## Git Workflow

Follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) when creating branches or commits:

- **Branch:** `type/short-description` (e.g. `chore/add-agent-skills`, `feat/wallet-page`)
- **Commits:** Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.); commit in logical chunks

**User confirmation:** Before running `git commit`, `git push`, or other irreversible commands, show the user what will be executed (e.g. staged files, commit message) and wait for explicit confirmation.
