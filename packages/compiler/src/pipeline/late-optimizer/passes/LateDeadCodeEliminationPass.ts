/**
 * A late Dead Code Elimination (DCE) pass that removes unused instructions
 * which define a place not read by any other instruction in the block
 * (and have no side effects). This pass is less aggressive than the
 * early DCE pass, which runs before the SSA elimination and has access
 * to phi nodes information.
 *
 * It relies on each instruction implementing:
 *    `public getReadPlaces(): Place[] { ... }`
 * which returns the list of places that instruction *reads*.
 *
 * Also, each instruction that "defines" a place should do so in a known field
 * (e.g. `lval` for StoreLocal, or `argumentPlace` for a BinaryExpression, etc.).
 *
 * For instructions that are "pure" and produce a result that no one reads, we remove them.
 * If an instruction is "impure" (side effects, function calls, etc.), we keep it even if unused.
 *
 * NOTE: This pass is local. If a variable is used in a different block,
 * we won't see it here and might remove it incorrectly if you haven't accounted for that globally.
